# MLTC-clustering
In this study, we explored techniques to optimise the interpretability of clusters of LTCs by applying existing topic modelling techniques to two datasets of patients with MLTC from the UK Biobank, to discover meaningful connections between long-term conditions. By assigning patients to interpretable clusters of LTCs based on their medical history, we can observe the evolution of co-occurring diseases over time, potentially discovering risk indicators that we can use to optimise the prediction of a patientâ€™s trajectory. We will then visualise the final clusters to analyse the complex combinations of co-occurring long-term conditions.
